    "description": "The Bengal tiger is the largest of all the big cat species. With its stripy orange coat and long, striped tail, tigers are very recognisable. An adult Bengal Tiger can be up to 3 metres long, tail included, and weigh more than 250 kilograms. Adult tigers have white spots of fur on the back of each ear, sotheir young can easily follow them in low light. No two tigers have the same stripes. They inhabit the forests and mangrove swamps of India, Burma, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Excellent swimmers, tigers are probably the most water-loving of felines.",

Koalas spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees, where they feed on the leaves. They have specialized adaptations, such as sharp claws and a strong grip, to climb and cling to the tree branches. Koalas are known for their calm and sleepy nature, spending up to 20 hours a day resting or sleeping in tree forks. They have a low metabolic rate and derive most of their water intake from eucalyptus leaves.",
